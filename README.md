# Inheritance Calculator

This is a Python program that helps users calculate how an inheritance will be divided among family members.

The program asks for the total amount of inheritance and lets the user specify the number of family members, as well as how the money should be distributed (equally or based on specific percentages). It then outputs how much each person will receive.

This tool is useful for making fair and transparent inheritance decisions.
